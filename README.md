# README

This repository contains my work during my internship in Niteroi, Brasil. I was working on extreme weather event forecasting in Rio de Janeiro. An extreme event in weather forecaster is such as an intense rainfall, a flooding, or a landslide.

My work focus on the prediction of rain using the São Cristóvão station of AlertaRio's dataset. This repository contains the experimentation I made on a Kaggle dataset and the São Cristóvão dataset. The experimentation made on the Kaggle dataset was to get used to the tools, like XGBoost, Jupyter, Python, Pandas. And the experimentation on the São Cristóvão dataset was the last I did in my internship and the ones which conclude my internship.
